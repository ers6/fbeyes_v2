fbeyes_000,,,Richard Wright,,,"A defining force in mid-twentieth-century African American literature, Richard Wright (1908-1960) became the world’s most famous black author with the hard-boiled naturalist novel Native Son</i> (1940) and the unsparing autobiography Black Boy</i>(1945). Born on a farm near Natchez, Mississippi, Wright began his literary career in big-city Chicago, where he joined the John Reed Club and the U.S. Communist Party. Increasingly dissatisfied by the Party, as well as by the earliest signs of the Second Red Scare, he moved to Paris in 1946. The FBI closely followed Wright’s progress, personal and professional, from 1942 through 1963, targeting his passport and keeping him on the Security Index of major threats to the U.S. even after his expatriation. Wright was highly conscious of FBI surveillance and police power more generally, addressing both in his unpublished Paris novel Island of Hallucination</i> (1959) and in the pained but humorous poem “The FB Eye Blues” (1949). After he passed away in 1960, Ollie Harrington, Amiri Baraka, and other black radicals suspected that the FBI or CIA was responsible for Wright’s sudden death.",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_000.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_000_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_000_th.jpg,"Richard Wright, a Black man, seated wearing a suit and tie, stares into the camera",,

After supporting a student strike at the conservative Hampton Institute, Patterson abandoned college teaching and moved to Harlem in 1928 with the help of an Urban League scholarship. There she met and briefly married the novelist Wallace Thurman and served as an editorial secretary for Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston as they coauthored Mule Bone</i>, their divisive, ill-fated folk drama.  In the 1930s, Patterson came into her own as a Communist activist and journalist, helping to usher Harlem’s literary intelligentsia further to the left.  The Vanguard, a salon she co-hosted, smoothly transitioned into the Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union.  Patterson recruited Hughes to help organize the visit of several dozen African American performers and intellectuals to the Soviet Union in 1932—a pivotal event in David Levering Lewis’s When Harlem Was in Vogue</i> (1981)and subsequent histories of the New Negro movement.  Thanks in part to her marriage to William L. Patterson, a headlining lawyer in the U.S. Communist Party, the FBI took Patterson’s activities with the utmost seriousness, building a 900-page file on her from 1941 to 1974.

All the while, Puerto Rican agents of the FBI struggled to discover exactly “what material [Mayfield] was typing.” Back in the U.S., he risked his life to help Robert Williams, the militant author of <em>Negroes with Guns </em>(1962), escape charges of armed insurrection. Forced to flee to Canada to avoid arrest, and then resettling in the newly independent African nation of Ghana, Mayfield worked as a literary advisor in the office of Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first president, editing the proceedings of the Accra Assembly.

fbeyes_034,,,Bob Kaufman,,,"<p>An inspiration for Allen Ginsberg and other Beat writers and possibly the inventor of the term “beatnik,” Bob Kaufman (1925-1986) also influenced Amiri Baraka and the Black Arts movement. Born in New Orleans to a part-Jewish father and a black Catholic mother, Kaufman’s poetry adopted the improvisational bravado and harmonic intricacy of Bebop jazz—a debt he acknowledged when naming his only son Parker, in honor of the famous bop saxophonist. While he preferred to leave his performative verse unwritten, his poems were eventually collected in the New Directions books <em>Solitudes Crowded with Loneliness </em>(1965) and <em>The Ancient Rain: Poems 1956-1978</em> (1981). His diverse thoughts on aesthetics were assembled in the earlier prose broadsides <em>Abomunist Manifesto </em>(1959), <em>Second April </em>(1959), and <em>Does the Secret Mind Whisper? </em>(1960). Kaufman identified with the bohemian life of the proto-surrealist poet Arthur Rimbaud, and the French returned the favor by christening him “<em>Rimbaud noir</em>” and translating his poetry. Less sympathetic, the FBI first became interested in Kaufman in 1950 as a “degenerate” member of the Communist Party, and continued to shadow him through 1970.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_034.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_034_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_034_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_036,,,Georgia Douglas Johnson,,,"<p>Georgia Douglas Johnson (1880-1966), a poet and salon hostess, was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but came to epitomize the black literary culture of Washington, D.C.; What she named “Half-Way House,” her longtime home at 1461 S Street, N.W., was one of the key feeder salons of the Harlem Renaissance. When in Washington, Jessie Fauset, Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer, and many other African American writers attended weekly Saturday night gatherings there; years later, Half-Way House attracted less artistic visitors from the FBI. Like Fauset, Johnson was practically a generation older than Hughes and Toomer, and did not publish her first poems until her mid-thirties. Yet she ranks as the most-published female poet of the Harlem Renaissance, the author of the collections <em>The Heart of a Woman </em>(1918), <em>Bronze </em>(1922), and <em>An Autumn Love Cycle </em>(1928). Recent critics of Johnson’s verse have discovered a quiet sedition in her careful lyrics set in traditional forms. Literary historian Gloria Hull has uncovered a trove of plays Johnson wrote in the 1920s, including <em>Plumes</em>, the winner of a 1927 literary contest sponsored by <em>Opportunity</em> magazine. FBI agents questioned Johnson in 1945 on the basis of “War Department regulations regarding soliciting communications between persons in…the military service and unknown individuals.”</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_036.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_036_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_036_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_038,,,Charles S. Johnson,,,"<p>Charles S. Johnson (1893-1956), an African American sociologist and Fisk University president, also served as a key editor and catalyst of the literary Harlem Renaissance. After earning a Ph.D. in sociology at the University of Chicago, Johnson was hired as the research director of the National Urban League, contributing to the influential commission report <em>The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot </em>(1922). Relocating to New York City, he assumed the editorship of the Urban League’s journal, <em>Opportunity</em>, which he crafted into a major outlet for Harlem Renaissance writing, nearly as important a venue for New Negro authors as <em>The Crisis</em> and <em>The Messenger</em>. Sterling Brown, Countee Cullen, and Zora Neale Hurston were among the <em>Opportunity </em>literary contest winners who went on to significant careers. According to historian David Levering Lewis, Johnson moved readily from sociology to literature because he calculated that while “the ballot box” and “the union hall” might be closed to many African Americans, “there remained two paths that had not been blocked”: arts and letters. Despite this pragmatic bet on black artistic advancement, Johnson remained close enough to his original discipline to write two classic sociological studies: <em>Shadow of the Plantation</em> (1934) and <em>Growing up in the Black Belt </em>(1940). The FBI amassed a 422-page personal file on Johnson during its Cold War boom years. With some irony, his grandson, Jeh Johnson, was named the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security in 2013.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_038.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_038_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_038_th.jpg,,,

Described by critic Trudier Harris as “a black nationalist without a movement,” Jeffers was featured in Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal’s anthology <em>Black Fire </em>(1968) but kept his distance from the inner circles of the Black Arts. Celebrating “blackness / Tender and strong, wounded and wise,” his poems were collected in such books as <em>My Blackness Is The Beauty of This Land </em>(1970), <em>O Africa, Where I Baked My Bread </em>(1977), and <em>Grandsire </em>(1979), the last devoted to his wife, Trellie James. His only novel, <em>Witherspoon </em>(1983), traced a black minister’s route to revolution.

fbeyes_042,,,Langston Hughes,,,"<p>One of the most recognizable names in African American letters, the Missouri-born Langston Hughes (1902-1967) wrote prolifically into the 1960s but is virtually synonymous with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, the era, he quipped, “when the Negro was in vogue.” A proudly professional author, Hughes worked in practically every literary genre, from novels to essays, autobiographies to children’s books, comic and agitprop dramas to not-so-simple stories. His reputation rests largely on his poetry, however, distinguished by its agile adaptation of blues and jazz stances and rhythms. Modern black verse is almost impossible to imagine without the populist modernism of Hughes’s <em>The Weary Blues </em>(1926), <em>Fine Clothes to the Jew </em>(1927), and <em>Montage of a Dream Deferred </em>(1951). Hughes enthusiastically visited the Soviet Union, and was made to pay dearly for his Depression-era support of Communist causes during the Cold War, but seems never to have joined the Communist Party. The FBI’s file-keepers nonetheless compiled over 550 pages on his life and works, impressed in particular by his claim that “Negroes are growing in international consciousness.” J. Edgar Hoover styled himself as a Hughes expert in his publication “Secularism—Breeder of Crime,” which includes an unfriendly interpretation of Hughes’s controversial 1932 poem “Goodbye, Christ” (“Listen, Christ,  / You did alright in your day, / I reckon…”).</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_042.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_042_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_042_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_044,,,Chester Himes,,,"<p>Often compared to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, Chester Himes (1909-1984) ranks as the most influential author of African American detective fiction. Raised in a middle-class household in Jefferson City, Missouri, Himes dropped out of the premedical track at Ohio State University, attracted by the nightlife and lowlife of Columbus. Convicted of armed robbery in 1928, he served eight years in jail, passing the time by honing his narrative voice in “Crazy in the Stir” (1934), “To What Red Hell” (1934), and other short stories of prison life. A string of autobiographical novels followed his parole, including <em>If He Hollers Let Him Go </em>(1945), a tale of 1940s Los Angeles in the naturalist style of Richard Wright, and <em>Lonely Crusade</em> (1947), an exposé of the racial politics of the Communist Party. In 1953, Himes joined Wright as an expatriate in France, where his work had already been translated. Encouraged to contribute to <em>La Série Noire</em>, a high-paying publisher of hard-boiled detective fiction, Himes quickly produced <em>For Love of Imabelle </em>(1957), a novel awarded the <em>Grand Prix de la Littérature Policière</em> at a televised Paris cocktail party. Afterward came seven other novels starring Himes’s most original creations, the Harlem detectives Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, among them <em>Cotton Comes to Harlem </em>(1965) and <em>The Heat’s On </em>(1966), each made into a studio film. In the words of Ishmael Reed, the Coffin Ed and Grave Digger series taught African American writers “the essential difference between a black detective and Sherlock Homes.” The FBI kept a file on Himes from 1944 to 1964, beginning with a reading of his prison stories and later checking on his whereabouts in France. Himes turned the tables on both FBI “file-style” and Richard Wright’s overbearing early influence in his novel <em>A Case of Rape</em>, written in 1956.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_044.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_044_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_044_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_046,,,Calvin Hernton,,,"<p>Best known for <em>Sex and Racism in America </em>(1965), a pioneering study of what would now be called the intersectionality of race and sexuality in the legacy of slavery, Calvin Hernton (1932-2001) was a history and sociology professor as well as a poet, novelist, and cultural critic. Hired as a social worker in New York City in 1960, he cofounded the black nationalist Umbra literary group in 1963. From 1965 to 1969, he studied in London with the existential psychologist R. D. Laing, an experience that helped to spark his thinking on the sexual foundations of American racism. As he speculated in <em>Sex and Racism in America</em>, white interest in black sexuality was “so immaculate and yet so perverse, so ethereal and yet so concrete, that all race relations tend to be, however subtly, <em>sexual </em>relations.” In Hernton’s novel <em>Scarecrow</em> (1974), interracial desire proves lethal aboard a Europe-bound ship of fools. In his last major work of nonfiction, <em>The Sexual Mountain and Black Women Writers </em>(1987), he adopted a womanist perspective to criticize the historical dismissal of literature by African American women. The FBI’s interest in Hernton was such that it carefully reviewed even his unpublished apprentice work. Interrogated by Bureau agents in person in 1955, Hernton protested that he was “not interested in Communism” and was so wrapped up in his writing “he does not know what goes on around him.”</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_046.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_046_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_046_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_048,,,Ollie Harrington,,,"<p>Ollie Harrington (1912-1995) was born in Valhalla, New York, a town whose name from Germanic mythology accidentally predicted his three decades of exile in East Germany. A visual artist whom Langston Hughes praised as “America’s greatest African-American cartoonist,” Harrington was also a significant political essayist and literary inspiration. In 1935, the Harlem <em>Amsterdam News </em>began running his comic strip <em>Dark Laughter</em>, its title signifying on Sherwood Anderson’s Negrophilic novel of 1925. Bootsie, the strip’s regular focus, was an African American everyman who remained Harrington’s most popular spokesman. “Jolly, rather well fed, but soulful,” as Harrington described him, Bootsie was in all three respects similar to his creator. In 1951, inspired in part by intrusive FBI surveillance, Harrington moved to Paris and became Richard Wright’s closest companion in a black expatriate community including James Baldwin, Chester Himes, and William Gardner Smith, all of whom drew on aspects of Harrington’s character in their Paris-set novels. When Wright died suddenly in 1960, Harrington suspected an assassination by the FBI and/or CIA. American-made “cloak-and-dagger terrorism,” Harrington believed, had doomed “the climate around the expatriate Paris community.” Moving even further toward the political left, Harrington requested political asylum in Communist East Germany in 1961. Harrington’s published writing, some of it produced as an international correspondent for the <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em>, includes <em>Terror in Tennessee: The Truth about the Columbia Outrages </em>(1946) and the posthumous collection <em>Why I Left America and Other Essays </em>(1993).

fbeyes_050,,,Lorraine Hansberry,,,"<p>If J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI had ever edited an anthology of African American writing, Lorraine Hansberry’s often-revived play <em>A Raisin in the Sun </em>(1959) might have been its central text. FBI officials monitored the progress of <em>Raisin</em> even before it premiered on Broadway, and sent an especially literate undercover agent to a Philadelphia try-out at the Walnut Theatre. “The play contains no comments of any nature about Communism as such,” this ghostreader certified in a sensitive review, “but deals essentially with negro [sic] aspirations, the problems inherent in their efforts to advance themselves, and varied attempts at arriving at solutions.” Hansberry’s FBI file predates <em>Raisin</em>, however, the first play by a black woman performed on Broadway and a winner of the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. Born into a well-to-do family in Chicago, Hansberry (1930-1965) was initially tracked by the Bureau in 1952, suspicions growing about her work for Paul Robeson’s newspaper <em>Freedom </em>and her travel to a Montevideo peace conference. The FBI closely followed her career after <em>Raisin</em> as well: her fundraising on behalf on the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and other civil rights involvements; her call for the abolition of the anticommunist House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC); and her second play on Broadway, the Greenwich Village-set bohemian drama <em>The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window </em>(1964). Her lengthy Bureau file, 1,020 pages thick, stopped growing only with her premature death of cancer in 1965. “To Be Young, Gifted and Black,” an anthemic song written in Hansberry’s honor by Nina Simone and Weldon Irvine, became a major R&amp;B hit in 1970.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_050.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_050_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_050_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_052,,,Hoyt Fuller,,,"<p>Hoyt Fuller (1923-1981), born in Atlanta and educated at Wayne State University in Detroit, launched his career in journalism at the <em>Detroit Tribune</em>, the <em>Michigan Chronicle</em>, and John H. Johnson’s <em>Ebony Magazine</em>. Frustrated with <em>Ebony</em>’s many lifestyle features as well as by the scope of white American racism, he abandoned his position as associate editor of the magazine in 1957 and roamed through France and Spain. Impressed by the anticolonial thought of Sekou Toure, the first president of the independent African nation of Guinea, he then toured Guinea and Algeria, a mind-altering homecoming he recreated in his memoir <em>Journey to Africa </em>(1971). John H. Johnson, willing to forgive Fuller’s defection from <em>Ebony</em>, turned to Fuller when seeking an editor for the revived <em>Negro Digest</em> in 1961. Fuller accepted the job, dropped the format of <em>Reader’s Digest</em>-like summaries of previously published articles, and transformed the journal into a serious, original forum on Pan-African art and politics. By 1970, <em>Negro Digest </em>had become <em>Negro Digest/Black World</em>, a change of name that reflected its new status as a beacon of the Black Arts movement. A typical issue, notes Richard A. Long, contained a number of poems and short stories, approximately eight articles on subjects from black health to Black Power, and a short essay by Fuller prominently displayed on the back cover. A complete and searchable run of the journal can now be found at Google Books. Addison Gayle’s influential anthology <em>The Black Aesthetic </em>(1971) drew on many stances and authors associated with <em>Negro Digest/Black World</em>. Fuller himself contributed the now-canonical essay “Towards a Black Aesthetic,” in which he declared that “the revolutionary black writer, like the new breed of militant activist, has decided that white racism will no longer exercise its insidious control over his work.” The FBI opened a file on Fuller in 1954, years before his stint as a major Black Arts editor, but this document may be most valuable for its documentation of Black Power meetings and conferences.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_052.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_052_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_052_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_054,,,E. Franklin Frazier,,,"<p>The Baltimore-born E. Franklin Frazier (1894-1962) entered the Harlem Renaissance through the pages of Alain Locke’s <em>New Negro </em>anthology (1925), contributing the essay “Durham: Capital of the Black Middle Class,” a piece that forecast his later focus on the black bourgeoisie. <em>Opportunity </em>magazine—a second prime venue for New Negro authors—awarded him an annual prize for another essay on the bases of social equality. His cutting sociological writing was not appreciated by every American audience, however. Frazier was forced to leave a teaching position at Morehouse College after his article “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” (1927) angered Atlanta whites with its claim that racism was akin to insanity. He made hay from this dismissal by entering the world-leading Ph.D. program in sociology at the University of Chicago. His doctoral dissertation on African American families in Chicago eventually grew into <em>The Negro Family in the United States </em>(1939), among the first comprehensive studies of its subject and the first written by a black sociologist. Countering the accent on African retentions in the work of anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits, Frazier here and elsewhere emphasized the American conditions and accommodations shaping African American culture. His final and most famous book, <em>Black Bourgeoisie </em>(1957), first published in French two years earlier, censured the African American elite—Frazier’s own class fraction—for its conspicuous consumption. J.

By the mid-1960s, however, Cruse had renounced the Communist Party and embraced an idiosyncratic black nationalism, attacking what he saw as the racial distortions of <em>Porgy and Bess </em>and <em>A Raisin in the Sun </em>and collaborating with Amiri Baraka to build the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School in Harlem. In 1967, Cruse published his lengthy and cantankerous tour de force, <em>The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual</em>, a polemical history that had an enormous impact on the first wave of Black Studies scholarship. Condemning what it saw as the assimilationist illusions of several generations of left-leaning black writers, <em>The Crisis </em>also indicted the growing call for “Black Power.” “In effect,” Cruse wrote, the Black Power idea “covers up a defeat without having to explain either the basic reasons for it or the flaws in the original strategy.” Reviewing an anniversary republication of <em>The Crisis </em>in 2007, critic Scott McLemee deemed Cruse’s study “one of the classic works of American cultural criticism. If the author seems cranky at times…well, so does Thorstein Veblen.” On the strength of <em>The Crisis</em>, the degreeless Cruse was hired to teach in the Afro-American Studies program at the University of Michigan, where he remained a professor until the mid-1980s. The FBI kept a file on Cruse from 1950 to 1969, first hoping to recruit him as an undercover Communist Party informant. In 1968, after the success of <em>The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual</em> led to its inclusion in the FBI library, a Bureau agent masquerading as a travel agent phoned Cruse’s New York apartment on a pretext call, hoping to discover his plans for international trips.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_056.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_056_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_056_th.jpg,,,

Not the last well-respected African American actress to find good roles hard to come by, Childress began to write eclectic dramas of her own, inspired in part by her friend Poitier’s bet that a well-crafted play could not be written overnight. <em>Florence </em>(1949), the result of Childress’s quick work, won the wager with Poitier and was produced by the ANT. Childress’s earliest full-length play, <em>Trouble in Mind </em>(1955), received the first Obie Award presented to an African American woman. <em>Wedding Band</em>, written in 1966, dealt with the explosive subject of interracial love, and was not produced in New York until 1972. Around this time, Childress began concentrating on young adult fiction, publishing <em>A Hero Ain’t Nothin’ But a Sandwich </em>(1973), a bestselling novel about a 13-year-old heroin user, still banned from some school collections. Like Lorraine Hansberry, her fellow playwright in the leftwing orbit of ANT and Paul Robeson’s journal <em>Freedom</em>, Childress was monitored through an individual FBI file. A resourceful Bureau agent, this file shows, dug deep for traces of Childress in the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of the New York Public Library.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_060.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_060_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_060_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_062,,,Frank London Brown,,,"<p>The literary reputation of Frank London Brown (1927-1962) rises and falls with <em>Trumbull Park </em>(1959), the single novel he published during his short life. Documenting the challenges faced by an African American family seeking to integrate a Chicago housing project, <em>Trumbull Park </em>is shaped by the influence of Richard Wright and of two earlier Chicago-focused naturalists Wright had emulated, Theodore Dreiser and Upton Sinclair. In the words of critic James C. Hall, the strength of Brown’s novel lies in its “detailed description of the ‘everyday’ of urban African American experience…and [its] philosophically sophisticated account of the rise of despair in the ghetto.” To Langston Hughes’s mind, however, this despair was <em>Trumbull Park</em>’s ultimate adversary: “How, in the end, determination and decency seem about to triumph, is the theme of this story, unfolded in terms of characters terribly alive and real.” Much like Wright, Brown moved to Chicago at the age of twelve and was attracted to the city’s political left, later serving as an organizer for the United Packinghouse Workers. Unlike the older writer, however, Brown was also drawn to Bebop jazz, publishing an interview with Thelonious Monk in <em>Down Beat </em>magazine and reading his fiction to the tune of jazz accompaniment. Brown first came to FBI attention as a unionist and Communist sympathizer in 1955, and was rewarded with a place on the Security Index, the kind of Bureau weapon Congressman Vito Marcantonio termed ""terror by index cards.""</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_062.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_062_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_062_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_064,,,Ralph Ellison,,,"<p>Ralph Ellison (1914-1994), born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, published only one novel during his lifetime. But what a novel it was: the densely symbolic, historically sweeping, and boldly surrealistic <em>Invisible Man </em>(1952) altered the course of African American writing in every genre and has been ranked by the Modern Library as one of the top twenty English-language novels of the twentieth century. “I am an invisible man,” declares Ellison’s self-conscious, hyper-articulate narrator in the novel’s memorable opening line, “not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allen Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood movie ectoplasms.  I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids —and I might even be said to possess a mind.   I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.” While he never completed <em>Invisible Man</em>’s intended follow-up, the novel posthumously published as <em>Juneteenth </em>(1999), Ellison also never stopped writing, publishing short fiction and brilliant essays on jazz music, nineteenth-century American literature, the interracial porousness of officially segregated U.S. culture, and <em>Invisible Man </em>itself, which he interpreted and defended, again and again, in the lectures and articles collected in <em>Shadow and Act </em>(1964) and <em>Going to the Territory </em>(1986). Unlike that of most of his audience, the FBI’s interest in Ellison was not fixated on <em>Invisible Man</em>. His Bureau file was opened before this novel was published, and it busied itself with the security challenges of his White House visits and American Academy in Rome fellowships. Had Ellison publicized the initial drafts of <em>Invisible Man</em>, however, the FBI’s stance might have been different. In one version of this Great African American Novel, the transparent narrator dreams of faithful service under “a master FBI man,” an unconscious confession of blindness that also divulges repressed ties between the mask of black servility and the loyal-American disguise of the G-Man.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_064.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_064_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_064_th.jpg,,,

Elder’s screenplay for <em>Sounder </em>(1972), a hit film starring Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield, received an Academy Award nomination and was widely praised as a nuanced and responsible alternative to the then-thriving genre of “Blaxploitation” movies.

Before his witty and strident verse, written under the Anglicized name of Ray, attracted the attention of Langston Hughes, Durem had joined the Communist Party, volunteered for the Loyalist cause during the Spanish Civil War, and worked as a union organizer in Los Angeles. In poems such as “I Know I’m Not Sufficiently Obscure” (1962)—“I know I’m not sufficiently obscure / to please the critics—nor devious enough. / Imagery escapes me. / I cannot find those mild and gracious words / to clothe the carnage”—Durem pled for the reunion of modern poetry and honest protest. His case impressed the Black Arts movement, which discovered him as a sympathetic elder and canonized him in Dudley Randall’s anthology <em>The Black Poets </em>(1971). One of Randall’s selections from Durem, “Award (A Gold Watch to the FBI Man Who has Followed Me for 25 Years)” (1964), dryly acknowledged the poet’s many days of intimate FBI surveillance, also captured in a 312-page file maintained between 1940 and 1967.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_068.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_068_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_068_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_070,,,Katherine Dunham,,,"<p>Katherine Dunham (1909-2006), born in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, has been cast as an artist with a double identity. On the one hand, she was “Katherine the Great,” the charismatic and technically precise Broadway and Hollywood dancer who appeared in <em>Cabin in the Sky </em>(1940), <em>Stormy Weather</em> (1943), and other popular black musicals. On the other hand, she was what Gregory S. Jackson calls “a pioneering dance anthropologist of world renown,” translating indigenous Caribbean dances into modern theatrical forms for her long-lived Katherine Dunham School of Dance, a crucial inspiration for Alvin Ailey, among others. According to dance critic Arthur Todd, Dunham integrated “a coherent lexicon of African and Caribbean styles of movement—a flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis and isolation of the limbs, a polyrhythmic strategy of moving”—with classic ballet and modern European techniques. Dunham had a third artistic identity as well, however, one that drew on her Ph.D. in anthropology and her distinctive blend of choreography and ethnological research. Beginning in the 1940s, she wrote a string of scholarly and imaginative books dealing with the Maroons of Jamaica (<em>Journey to Accompong</em> [1946]); her childhood in Illinois (<em>A Touch of Innocence </em>[1959]); her dreams of Africa (<em>Kasamance: A Fantasy</em> [1974]); and the meaning of Haitian dance (the definitive <em>Dances of Haiti </em>[1983]). Always an outspoken activist, she opened the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_Arts_Training_Center"">Performing Arts Training Center</a> (PATC) in East St. Louis in 1967, a Black Arts-style project to defeat material poverty through artistic expression. The FBI kept tabs on Dunham from 1944 to 1968, complicating her international travels. Walter Winchell, the creator of the modern gossip column, telegrammed FBI headquarters in 1948 with a prurient tease about Dunham’s School of Dance: “You’d be gee-whizzed at the after-hour orgies that take place thrice weekly at one of [New York’s] most famous interpretive dance studios.”</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_070.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_070_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_070_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_072,,,Shirley Graham Du Bois,,,"<p>The 1,068-page FBI file of Shirley Graham Du Bois (1896-1977) exceeds that of her famous husband, W.E.B. Du Bois, by over 300 pages. As the Bureau’s ghostreaders recognized, her career as a novelist, composer, playwright, and activist outlived his, and began decades before their marriage in 1951. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Graham Du Bois studied music and French in the preferred New Negro destination of Paris prior to earning B.A. and M.A. degrees from Oberlin College. Her name in musical theater was made when she expanded her one-act play <em>Tom-Tom</em> into a 1932 opera with an all-black cast, perhaps the first such opera produced by an African American woman. The mid-1930s found her employed by the Federal Theater Project and composing the theme song for Theodore Ward’s <em>Big White Fog</em> (1939). A scholarship to the Yale School of Drama then inspired several plays of her own: <em>I Gotta Home </em>(1940), <em>Elijah’s Raven </em>(1941), and <em>Dust of Earth </em>(1941). Her growing frustration with the limits of the commercial theater led her deeper into political work—first for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and then as a member of the Communist Party. Along with other leftist writers battered by the Cold War, she found relative freedom in the genre of young adult literature, publishing biographies of Frederick Douglass (1949), Pocahontas (1953), and Booker T. Washington (1955), among many others. The FBI caught up with Graham Du Bois as she attempted to travel internationally along with W.E.B. Du Bois. The couple faced the worst of the Bureau’s Cold War strictures, their passports seized and their places on the Security Index secured. Her years in Ghana working to develop the new black nation’s television service were troubled by FBI surveillance as well as by a CIA-supported coup.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_072.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_072_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_072_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_074,,,St. Clair Drake,,,"<p>The son of a Barbadian father who organized for Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), St. Clair Drake (1911-1990) attended Hampton University and participated in its pitched student strike of 1927, the training ground for a surprising number of New Negro intellectuals. An English minor and the editor of the Hampton student newspaper, Drake took his literary talent with him while studying anthropology and sociology at the University of Chicago, the home of the influential “Chicago School” of urban ethnography. While still a Ph.D. candidate, he and Horace R. Cayton coauthored the classic <em>Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City </em>(1945), an 830-page survey of Bronzeville whose inspiration to imaginative writers was predicted by its introduction by Richard Wright. Speaking as a fellow black Chicagoan, Wright praised the book as “a landmark of research and scientific achievement” and as an explanatory key to his novel <em>Native Son </em>(1940). Drake’s significance was not confined to sociology and its effects on the realist fiction of the Chicago Renaissance. He was also a dedicated Pan-Africanist who advised Kwame Nkrumah and other post-independence African leaders, and he built a model center for Black Studies at Stanford University starting in 1969. Drake’s 335-page FBI file, constructed between 1961 and 1971, is especially concerned with his African contacts.  </p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_074.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_074_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_074_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_076,,,Frank Marshall Davis,,,"<p>Frank Marshall Davis (1905-1987), a poet, journalist, and lifelong leftist, reentered the news in 2008 when his friendship with a young Hawaiian, Barack Obama, was employed to slur the future President’s political past. Obama’s memory of Davis in his memoir <em>Dreams from My Father </em>(1995) is less than worshipful, however: “It made me smile, thinking back on Frank and his old Black Power, dashiki self. In some ways he was as incurable as my mother, as certain in his faith, living in the same sixties time warp that Hawaii had created.” Davis’s literary career was in fact more deeply rooted in the Chicago of the 1930s than in the Hawaii of the 1960s. After studying journalism at Kansas State University, he moved to the Windy City in 1927 and then wrote and edited for African American newspapers including the <em>Chicago Whip </em>and the <em>Chicago Evening Bulletin</em>. He met Margaret Walker, Richard Wright, and other aspiring poets and novelists and joined three of the core institutions of the black Chicago Renaissance of the Great Depression: the Federal Writers’ Project, the South Side Writers Group, and the U.S. Communist Party. In a harsh climate for book publishing, not least for black poets, he succeeded in bringing out several volumes of poetry: <em>Black Man’s Verse </em>(1935), <em>I Am the American Negro </em>(1937), and <em>Through</em> <em>Sepia Eyes</em> (1938). Captivated by what he called “the new revolutionary style [of] free verse,” Davis developed a poetic voice marked by both technical experimentation and fierce racial pride. Davis moved to Hawaii with his second wife in 1948, and there wrote a weekly column, “Frank-ly Speaking,” for the <em>Honolulu Record</em>, a newspaper published by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). On the evidence of his FBI file, nearly 700 pages compiled between 1944 and 1963, Bureau agents read this column closely and faithfully, systematically comparing its contents to the “Communist Party line.”</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_076,/objects/small/fbeyes_076_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_076_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_078,,,Sterling Brown,,,"<p>Sterling A. Brown (1901-1989), educated at Williams College and Harvard University, was born on the same Howard University campus where he would serve as a popular and demanding professor of literature for forty years. A black poets’ poet as well as an influential classroom teacher of Amiri Baraka, Ossie Davis, and Toni Morrison, Brown stressed the higher wisdom of black vernacular music and folklore. (According to another of his distinguished students, the black conservative Thomas Sowell, Brown insisted that the wisdom offered by Harvard had, by contrast, “ruined more [Negroes] than bad liquor.”) Brown’s poetry collection <em>Southern Road </em>(1932) joined the work of Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston in demonstrating that African American dialect could escape the tired keys of pathos and humor. Despite Brown’s distaste for the idea of the Harlem Renaissance, the blues-tinged verse in <em>Southern Road </em>was received as one of this movement’s major statements and challenges. As critic James Smethurst suggests, Brown’s assumption “that the culture of the Black Belt is alive and vital” tested the vision of Jean Toomer’s <em>Cane </em>(1923), which had proposed that black “rural culture, and the perceived closeness of that culture to the land and nature,” was waning. Brown underlined the national—not just rural and Southern—importance of African American literature in a series of diligent and innovative studies including <em>The Negro in American Fiction </em>(1937) and <em>Negro Poetry and Drama </em>(1937). The FBI opened its file on Brown in 1941, concerned by his apparent Communism and possible violation of the Hatch Act. Confronting him in a face-to-face interview, FBI agents were treated to a lengthy discussion of Brown’s opinions on art, race, and American democracy. “I have gotten, I suppose[,] the reputation as a radical because of my position on the race matter in America,” Brown proudly concluded.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_078.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_078_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_078_th.jpg,,,

Brown’s (1913-2003) adopted surname reflected his admiration for John Brown, the militant abolitionist, and his need for cover when working as a Communist labor organizer. Arrested for conspiracy during a union drive in Pennsylvania, Brown was imprisoned in the Allegheny County Jail for seven months in 1941, a brutal experience which nonetheless led to his greatest literary success, the novel <em>Iron City</em> (1951). Alternately described as a derivative radical restatement of Richard Wright’s <em>Native Son </em>(1940) and as the original African American prison novel, <em>Iron City </em>employs quasi-documentary materials to expose the racism of what is now called the “prison-industrial complex”—a concept that Brown anticipates in his title, which refers at once to the iron-making industrial system of Pittsburgh and to the unyielding society of the penitentiary. <em>Iron City</em>’s unambiguous heroes are a trio of African American Communists, and Brown would not renounce the Communist Party even during the Cold War. For several years the managing editor of <em>New Masses</em>, the U.S. Party’s major cultural journal, he also served as an associate editor of its successor publication, <em>Masses and Mainstream</em>. In the 1950s, Brown began a second literary career as Paul Robeson’s coauthor, collaborating on columns and articles and helping the singer-activist write his manifesto/autobiography, <em>Here I Stand</em> (1958). The FBI was little friendlier to Brown than to Robeson, filling a file on him from 1940 to 1970.

While she failed to collect her literary work in books of her own, Bennett’s regular column in <em>Opportunity</em>, “The Ebony Flute,” helped to make successes of several other black authors as it spread word of artistic Harlem’s gatherings and achievements. Bennett’s career is often assumed to have ended with the fading of the Harlem Renaissance during the Great Depression, but she lived on to direct the Harlem Community Arts Center from 1939 to 1944.

Born Everett LeRoy Jones to middle-class parents in Newark, New Jersey, Baraka died in the same city, the “New Ark” where his son, Ras Baraka, was elected mayor in 2014. The practical inventor of the Black Arts movement, Baraka also flung himself into multiple reinventions of identity, style, and genre. The 1950s saw Baraka, then known as LeRoi Jones, thriving in the interracial bohemia of Greenwich Village while writing and publishing Beat-influenced poetry. In the early 1960s, he won an Obie Award for the unforgiving black-white drama <em>Dutchman </em>(1964) and published <em>Blues People </em>(1963), a seminal history of African American music considered as “the history of the Afro-American people as text, as tale, as story, [and] as exposition.” Baraka’s art and activism took a more radical black nationalist turn after the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, a crime for which he eventually blamed the FBI. Within months of the murder, Baraka had moved to Harlem and founded the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS), the prototypical institution of the Black Arts movement. Though it had opened in 1957 with inquiries into Baraka’s possible Communism, his FBI file ballooned with the establishment of BARTS. Bureau informers, present at BARTS’s first meetings in Harlem, also recorded some of Baraka’s poetry readings as he toured the U.S. Baraka fought back against FBI secrecy by making portions of his FBI file public years prior to his death.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_084.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_084_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_084_th.jpg,,,

An inexhaustible public witness and the author of plays, essays, novels, and short stories, he ranks with the most daring and eloquent African American voices of the twentieth century. His first novel, the autobiographical <em>Go Tell It on the Mountain </em>(1953), wrestled with the heritage of black Christianity and joined Ralph Ellison’s <em>Invisible Man </em>(1952) in a dramatic break from Richard Wright’s social realism. His second novel, <em>Giovanni’s Room </em>(1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the complexity of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall riots announced the gay rights movement. His lush and searching essays, many dissecting the American way of race, sex, and democracy, are his most acclaimed works. <em>Notes of a Native Son </em>(1955), his earliest essay collection, has been included on the Modern Library’s list of the top twenty nonfiction books of the twentieth century. Another collection, the bestselling <em>The Fire Next Time</em> (1963), is a classic of the civil rights movement. After 1948, Baldwin lived mainly in Europe but remained tied to events in the U.S. thanks in part to the FBI. Spanning sixteen years (1958-1974) and 1,884 pages, Baldwin’s Bureau file is among the most exhaustive of the civil rights and Black Power eras. In it, FBI ghostreaders document Baldwin’s international travels, his sexual and political affinities, and his literary output, noting the purchase of many of his titles for the headquarters library. Baldwin in turn took a keen interest in the FBI, promising to blast J. Edgar Hoover “to the wall” in a never-finished exposé titled <em>The Blood Counters.</em></p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_086.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_086_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_086_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_088,,,W.E.B. Du Bois,,,"<p>W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963), known even at the FBI as the “father of ‘Pan-Africanism,’” was an enormously prolific author, scholar, and civil rights activist with a mature career spanning some seven decades from the 1890s to the 1960s. Born far from the Deep South in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and trained as the first African American Ph.D. from Harvard University, Du Bois can be said to have invented the modern type of the black activist-intellectual. He was a cofounder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); a leader of the Niagara Movement opposing the social and educational compromises of Booker T. Washington; a pioneer of scientific sociology in <em>The Philadelphia Negro </em>(1899); an organizer of multiple Pan-African Congress meetings in Paris, London, and other European capitals; the editor of the NAACP’s <em>Crisis </em>magazine during the prime of the Harlem Renaissance; a groundbreaking revisionist historian of American race relations in <em>Black Reconstruction </em>(1935); and the architect of the <em>Encyclopedia Africana</em>, a comprehensive reference work on the black world completed only after his 1963 death in Ghana. <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em> (1903), Du Bois’s most significant work of imaginative literature, contains a famous transnational prediction— “the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line”—as well as the most influential concept-metaphor in African American letters: that of “double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.” To the FBI, the multitalented Du Bois was “a great negro [sic] educator, author, lecturer, and publisher,” but also a major threat to U.S. national greatness. During the Cold War, the Bureau collaborated with the State Department to seize Du Bois’s U.S. passport. After his exile to Ghana and his enrollment in the U.S. Communist Party, it investigated his late-life editorship of the <em>Encyclopedia Africana</em>. Altogether, Du Bois’s FBI file reached 756 pages between 1942 and 1963, and his early New Negro journalism featured prominently in what may be the Bureau’s inaugural work of literary criticism, <em>Radicalism and Sedition among the Negroes as Reflected in Their Publications </em>(1919).</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_088.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_088_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_088_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_090,,,Black Arts Repertory Theater/School,,,"<p>A cornerstone of the Black Arts movement, the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS) was founded by Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) in Harlem in 1965. Provoked by the assassination of Malcolm X, Baraka envisioned a black artistic school responsive to the black community, attached to the militant politics of the Black Power movement, and rooted in the same urban landscape as the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. Although BARTS operated for less than a year, it attracted artists of the talent of Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, and Sonia Sanchez, and inspired dozens of similar Black Arts incubators across the U.S., propagating the Black Arts movement into the 1970s. The FBI kept a close watch on BARTS even before its official opening, with federal informers present at some of the school’s earliest meetings. FBI spies attended BARTS’s summer education classes, sitting in on Harold Cruse’s groundbreaking Afro-American history course. Baraka himself believed that the early break-up of BARTS was caused in part by FBI tampering.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_090.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_090_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_090_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_092,,,John Henrik Clarke,,,"<p>John Henrik Clarke (1915-1998), born to sharecroppers in Union Springs, Alabama, changed his middle name from Henry in honor of the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, a pioneer of theatrical modernism. Clarke in turn strived to modernize the field of African American history, inspired by his migration to New York City during the final years of the Harlem Renaissance and by the mentorship of Arthur A. Schomburg, whose 10,000-piece collection of Afro-Americana provided the core of what is now the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Clarke began his writing life with the story “On the Other Side” (1938) and later contributed to African American fiction as the editor of <em>American Negro Short Stories </em>(1966) and <em>William Styron’s Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond </em>(1968), a collection offering stern criticism of a white novelist’s bestselling fantasy of black slave rebellion. Yet Clarke’s most important work as a writer took the form of nearly two-dozen books and pamphlets on African world history seen from a black nationalist perspective. Motivated to dispel the illusion that black history began with European colonization and had no extensive impact on the U.S., he published such titles as <em>Harlem U.S.A. </em>(1971), <em>Marcus Garvey and the Vision of Africa </em>(1973), and the inclusive <em>African People in World History </em>(1991). Despite his lack of a Ph.D., he helped to establish Black Studies programs at both Hunter College and Cornell University, the latter of which now hosts the John Henrik Clarke Africana Library (like his mentor Schomburg, Clarke’s name thus identifies a major black archive). Clarke’s FBI file, opened as early as 1961, casts him as a “well-known Negro writer” and contains evidence of surveillance of his residence as well as his many publications. By 1972, the FBI had alerted the Secret Service of his potential danger due to his “background, emotional instability or activity in groups engaged in activities inimical to [the] U.S.” Clarke’s file is provided thanks to the original FOIA research of Reginald Smith.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_092.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_092_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_092_th.jpg,,,

fbeyes_094,,,The Black Scholar,,,"<p><em>The Black Scholar</em>, one of the first academic journals of Black Studies, was created by Robert Chrisman and Nathan Hare in 1969 as an outlet for activist research on the black world. Dedicated to “uniting the academy and the street,” the publication’s pages have featured everyone from Angela Davis to Henry Louis Gates Jr., C.L.R. James to Wole Soyinka, Max Roach to Alice Walker. Special issues have hosted debates on Ebonics, reparations, affirmative action, multiculturalism, and the role of women in the Black Power movement. The FBI quietly purchased multiple subscriptions and kept a file on <em>The Black Scholar </em>from 1971 to 1976. Relaunched in 2012, the publication currently describes itself as “a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal providing cogent articles that help the understanding of issues of social concern to black Americans and other peoples of African descent across the world.”</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_094.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_094_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_094_th.jpg,,,

By its fortieth anniversary in 1985, its circulation had grown to 2,300,000 readers. While typically focusing on black elected officials and celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment, <em>Ebony</em> ran a regular column by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the late 1950s and occasionally featured contributions by black literary intellectuals such as Langston Hughes. The FBI opened a file on the magazine in 1947 and periodically used its pages as an outlet for promotional articles starring black FBI agents.</p>",,,,,,,compound_object_fbeyes,/objects/fbeyes_096.jpeg,/objects/small/fbeyes_096_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/fbeyes_096_th.jpg,,,

Its revised title, <em>Black World</em>, reflected Fuller’s embrace of the vision and terminology of the Black Power movement.
