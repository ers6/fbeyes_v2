object_000,,,Richard Wright,,,"A defining force in mid-twentieth-century African American literature, Richard Wright (1908-1960) became the world’s most famous black author with the hard-boiled naturalist novel <i>Native Son</i> (1940) and the unsparing autobiography <i>Black Boy</i>(1945). Born on a farm near Natchez, Mississippi, Wright began his literary career in big-city Chicago, where he joined the John Reed Club and the U.S. Communist Party. Increasingly dissatisfied by the Party, as well as by the earliest signs of the Second Red Scare, he moved to Paris in 1946. The FBI closely followed Wright’s progress, personal and professional, from 1942 through 1963, targeting his passport and keeping him on the Security Index of major threats to the U.S. even after his expatriation. Wright was highly conscious of FBI surveillance and police power more generally, addressing both in his unpublished Paris novel <i>Island of Hallucination</i> (1959) and in the pained but humorous poem “The FB Eye Blues” (1949). After he passed away in 1960, Ollie Harrington, Amiri Baraka, and other black radicals suspected that the FBI or CIA was responsible for Wright’s sudden death.",,,,,,,compound_object,,/objects/small/object_001.jpeg,/objects/thumbs/object_001.jpeg,"Richard Wright, a Black man, seated wearing a suit and tie, stares into the camera",,,,

His brave investigations of lynching—assisted by his light skin color—resulted in the non-fictional exposé <i>Rope and Faggot: A Biography of Judge Lynch</i> (1929).

After supporting a student strike at the conservative Hampton Institute, Patterson abandoned college teaching and moved to Harlem in 1928 with the help of an Urban League scholarship. There she met and briefly married the novelist Wallace Thurman and served as an editorial secretary for Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston as they coauthored <i>Mule Bone</i>, their divisive, ill-fated folk drama.  In the 1930s, Patterson came into her own as a Communist activist and journalist, helping to usher Harlem’s literary intelligentsia further to the left.  The Vanguard, a salon she co-hosted, smoothly transitioned into the Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union.  Patterson recruited Hughes to help organize the visit of several dozen African American performers and intellectuals to the Soviet Union in 1932—a pivotal event in David Levering Lewis’s <i>When Harlem Was in Vogue</i> (1981)and subsequent histories of the New Negro movement.  Thanks in part to her marriage to William L. Patterson, a headlining lawyer in the U.S. Communist Party, the FBI took Patterson’s activities with the utmost seriousness, building a 900-page file on her from 1941 to 1974.

Motley’s literary talent was recognized early: the <i>Chicago Defender</i>, one of the country’s agenda-setting black newspapers, hired him to write its “Bud Says” children’s column.  He served with fellow Chicago naturalists Richard Wright and Nelson Algren in the Federal Writers Project, but his big break arrived with <i>Knock on Any Door</i> (1947), a bestseller centered on an Italian-American altar boy-turned-criminal.  “Live fast, die young and have a good-looking corpse” advised Motley’s protagonist, Nick Romano, in what became a famous slogan.  <i>Knock on Any Door</i>’s status as a representative “white-life” or “raceless” black text was cemented by a 1949 film adaptation starring Humphrey Bogart.  <i>Let No Man Write My Epitaph</i> (1958), a sequel to Romano’s story written in Motley’s adopted home of Mexico, inspired another Hollywood movie.  Exercised by his homosexuality as much as by his status as a leftist expatriate, the FBI kept a file on Motley from 1951 to 1967.  After the anti-gay provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act prevented a return visit to Chicago, Motley would die in Mexico City.  <i>Let Noon Be Fair</i>, a novel of Mexico completed before his passing, was published in 1966, Motley by then having become, in Clarence Major’s phrase, a “kind of ghost among Negro writers.”",1951,1967

His earliest books, <i>Songs of Jamaica</i> and <i>Constab Ballads</i>, both published in 1912, introduced Jamaican creole as a serious language for modern poetry.  His stirring Shakespearian sonnet “If We Must Die” (1919) is often identified as the inaugural poem of the Harlem movement; his initial American poetry collection, <i>Harlem Shadows</i> (1922), contains much of the Standard English verse that James Weldon Johnson described as “one of the principal forces in bringing about the Negro literary awakening.”  The uninhibited novel <i>Home to Harlem</i> (1928), written in France while McKay feared interference from the FBI and other state intelligence agencies, became the first black bestseller of the New Negro era.  McKay’s long string of literary “firsts” helped to make him the first African American author to be tracked in an FBI file of his own.
